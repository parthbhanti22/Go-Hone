The class for my Parallel and distributed computing course is useless. Its a time waste. No teaching at all. So I thought why not spend some time learning a bit of Go. 
For now I have started basic syntaxes and stuff. I am learning from the docs only. They are weird and unclear. But I don't want to watch a stupid youtube video. And also I am a bit of an old school guy.
My learning curve used to start with using AI for everything and then crying about it and then actually learning it. There's no point in using AI anymore. 
I used to do a bit of frontend. Then AI got too ahead and we fell too behind. For now, backend, cloud and systems engineering remain mostly immune to these bots atleast to some extend. So I am learning Go to avoid them.
Also CLI tools are really cool. Love them honestly. Hence Go..
I will update this readme as a stupid ass blog cause why not.
